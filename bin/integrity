  echo "This simple program attempts to detect file corruption. It works by calculating
checksums (SHA-256) of files and storing them in a file (.sdb, for “checksum
database”).

At any later point, you can then use the program to check that the files have
the same checksums as before.

Usage:

$program check old.sdb new.sdb

  Given 2 checksum database (sdb) files, prints out any mismatches, indicating
  file corruption.

$program db pathname [...]

  For each pathname naming a directory, reads every regular file under the
  pathname and calculates the files’ checksums. Stores the checksums and file
  pathnames in pathname-[timestamp].sdb, a sibling of pathname.

$program sum pathname [...]

  For each pathname naming a regular file, calculates and prints the checksum
  and pathname." > /dev/stderr
