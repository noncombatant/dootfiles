help="This simple program attempts to detect file corruption. It works by calculating
checksums (SHA-256) of files and storing them in a file (.sdb, for “checksum
database”).

At any later point, you can then use the program to check that the files have
the same checksums as before.

Usage:

  integrity check old.sdb new.sdb

Given 2 checksum database (sdb) files, prints out any mismatches, indicating
file corruption.

  integrity db pathname [sdb-file]

For each pathname naming a directory, reads every regular file under the
pathname and calculates the files’ checksums. Stores the checksums and file
pathnames in either sdb-file (if given), or pathname-[timestamp].sdb (a sibling
of pathname).

  integrity sum pathname [...]

For each pathname naming a regular file, calculates and prints the checksum and
pathname."
